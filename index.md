# Intro to data visualization with Tableau

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Recognize the characteristics of an effective visualization
2. Format data for visualization
3. Create a simple visualization using Tableau software

## Pre-workshop setup
This workshop includes hands-on practice with Tableau software. To participate fully please do the following **before the workshop**

1. Install [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/) (free) or [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students) (free for students) on your computer. Both versions work equally well for this workshop.
2. Download the [Labour Force Survey, 2020 sample dataset](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1ke_9HZ9qoOLOPbWC5XhW3cw-70ba9Rua) (CSV file on Google Drive, 72MB).
3. **Optional:** if you are using _Tableau Public_ and would like to save your work, sign up for a free [Tableau Public account](https://public.tableau.com/).

Requests for the free _Tableau Desktop_ student license are verified first, the download is not immediate. If installing shortly before the workshop choose _Tableau Public_ instead.

## Why Tableau? 
This workshop uses _Tableau Public_ software to introduce data visualization concepts because it is freely available and accessible to beginners. 

This is not an endorsement of Tableau: there are many options for data visualization and other software may be better in other contexts. While suitable as a teaching tool, _Tableau Public_ imposes limitations that users should be aware of:

- Visualizations cannot be saved locally, they must be saved to a _Tableua Public_ account online. Work saved to the cloud can be hidden from public view but this is not suitable for private or sensitive data. 
- Dataset size limit of 1M records
- Cannot connect directly to databases

_Tableau Desktop_ does not have these limits, but it is not free. 

Students at accredited academic institutions are eligible for a free one-year trial of _Tableau Desktop_ (see <https://www.tableau.com/academic/students>).
