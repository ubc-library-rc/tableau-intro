# Saving your work
Use the _File -> Save_ menu to save your work as a Tableau _workbook_. The saving options depend on which Tableau product you are using.

- **Tableau Desktop Public Edition** users must save their work to an online Tableau Public account. Accounts are free, but saving online is not suitable if you are working with private or sensitive data.
- **Tableau Desktop** users may save their work locally or to an online Tableau Public account.
